## Project Description

Deep Learning with PyTorch
  - Based on "Generative Adversarial Nets" paper: 
      https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf / https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661
  - DCGAN PyTorch implementation follows this example: 
      https://github.com/pytorch/examples



## Dataset

1) Frames of Videos by Hannah Reber and Gert-Jan Akerboom

2) Generated pictures by GAN-DALF in "god" folders



## Workflow

With every session I made some little changes (concerning the learning rate, workes, input data or input folder structure for example) and monitored closely how each change affected the generated output.
After every session I made a selection of generated pictures and introduced them into the input data.
